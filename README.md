# Welcome To The Wherego's React Tutorial

This is a React + Redux introductory tutorial made by Wherego for training purposes.

You need to have node.js and npm installed to use this tutorial.

To start, `git clone` this repository to your local machine.

There are 6 steps in this tutorial, each located in a separate branch. To access each branch, use the command `git checkout step-X`, where `X` stand for number 1-6. It is, of course, highly recommended that you start from step-1.

After you are done with each step, proceed to the next one by using `git reset --hard` followed by `git checkout step-X`.

In each step, there will be main instructions in the README.md file. The content are mostly informational. Some times your actions are required. Those items will be preceeded by bolded `Action` keyword.

**Action** Enjoy!
